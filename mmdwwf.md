Here are the matching and closely related weeds with a brief detail on each:

* Amaranthus retroflexus (Redroot Pigweed):
 This broadleaf weed is directly present in both the dataset and your corn weed list. It is known for its rapid growth and competition with crops for resources.

* Poa annua and Poa pratensis (Kentucky Bluegrass):
 The dataset includes Poa annua, a common grass weed in wheat fields. Although not identical, it is closely related to Poa pratensis (found in your list) as they share the same genus, both being grasses that can interfere with crop growth.

* Bromus japonicus and Bromus arvensis (Field Brome):
 The dataset lists Bromus japonicus as a weed in wheat fields, which is closely related to Bromus arvensis in your list. Both belong to the Bromus genus and share similar growth habits in cereal crop environments.
